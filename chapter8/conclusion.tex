\hspace{1.5cm}
In this project, we have developed the new alternative way to help the disabled people who can not move their part of the body but their brain still is functional by using EEG brain wave to interact with the equipment. We have studied in various techniques to use with ERP and SSVEP to help the subject interact with the equipment. We have studied about the duty cycle,light intensity,light color and light luminance to use in our project.\par
We also have developed the hardware which is the visual stimulator combine with the tablet to command the program that we create for the subjects that we have already described in previous chapters. In ERP experiment, we investigate the EEG data from subjects and use these data to calculate the accuracy. The conclusion of ERP is when we obtain more trials of subjects , the accuracy rate will increase. In SSVEP experiment, to identify the flicker of visual stimular we use windows function
