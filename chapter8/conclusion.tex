\section{Summary of Thesis Achievements}

\hspace{1.5cm}In this project, we separate the project in 2 categories. First, the Event Related Potential(ERP). The next category is Steady State Visual Evoke Potential(SSVEP). The accuracy of ERP in our experiment1 is 80\% and the accuracy of experiment2 is 85\%. However, there are 2 obstacles of the experiment. The first obstacle is the chamber. We perform our experiment in the chamber only. If the experiment is conducted outside of the chamber, the accuracy will be lower for both experiments. The second obstacle is a great amount of time. In our experiment, trial with the least time-consuming takes 11 seconds and the most time-consuming trial takes 23 seconds. Each command require too much time to execute. When we have these obstacles, another algorithm should be used to reduce to effect of both obstacles.
