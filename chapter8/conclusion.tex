\section{Summary of Thesis Achievements}

In this project, we seperate the project in 2 categories first is Event Related Potential(ERP),the next one is Steady State Visual Evoke Potential(SSVEP). First, we will talk about the ERP. The accuracy of ERP in our experiment is good rate. But there are some obstacle of the experiment. First obstacle is chamber, we do our experiment in chamber only. If we do our experiment in outside of the chamber , the accuracy maybe lower than this.
